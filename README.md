# VE Customizations
This repository contains Primo VE customizations that are not part of the [Alliance Central Package](https://github.com/alliance-pcsg/ve-central-package).
You may copy from these files into the custom.js of a local package and modify as needed to work for your institution.

## [Add Buffer to Advanced Search Terms](https://github.com/alliance-pcsg/ve-customizations/blob/main/buffer-advanced-search.js)
This customization adds a buffer to the beginning of the searh terms displayed under the collapsed Advanced Search form,
to prevent the field from being destroyed when a patron uses the backspace. See the
[video demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dbVx__-NSyyl-1poJZbaR0YiVLRa56OC/view?usp=sharing).

## [Move Focus to Action on Hover](https://github.com/alliance-pcsg/ve-customizations/blob/main/focus-action-on-hover.js)
The intended behavior of Primo VE is to retain focus on the first action in a list only, even when users mouse over other actions. This customization moves focus to other actions on hover.
